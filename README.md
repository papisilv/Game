  I am currently building a slot machine that randomly selects a fruit square. At the moment, the app does not have access to picking a fruit, but I am working hard on implementing it soon. It uses Node.js as the back-end with the next packages: Morgan, Express, Method-Override, Body-Parser and EJS.
