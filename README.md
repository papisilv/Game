  I am currently building a slot machine that randomly selects a fruit square. At the moment, the app does not have access to picking a fruit, but I am working hard on implementing it soon. It uses Node.js as the back-end with the next packages: Morgan, Express, Method-Override, Body-Parser and EJS.

<h2 align="center">Install and Deployment</h2>
<p align="left"> 
  In order to run the app you need to follow a couple of easy steps.
</p>
<p align="left"> 
  First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (I am currently on the newest version 14.15.3). After that, you must open the folder Game with the console and install some packages using **npm**. 
</p>
<p align="left"> 
  Copy and paste this on the console to install all packages required: ** npm i ejs body-parser express method-override morgan**
</p>
<p align="left"> 
  Finally, on the console just type **node app.js**. Then, open your favorite web browser. Type in the web browser address bar **localhost:3000** and enjoy the app!
